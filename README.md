iTec's XVI-th edition of 2023, game-development. Theme: senses.

During the span of 2 days, me and my friend, Teodor Vuia (github: nerfstorm), created a game using Unity. It features a procedural map (kind of the old maps Nintendo used for old Pokemon or Zelda games) where you are a wolf, and you must use your smell in order to find your enemies.

The project is not finished though, as we did not have enough time to do so.
